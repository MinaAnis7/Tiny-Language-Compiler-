# Tiny-Language Compiler
## Project Description
Compiler for Tiny-Programming Language that checks whether the language is typed correctly or not passing Through the Compilation phases. And Finally, creates a parse tree to show the structure of typed code in that language.

## Compilation Phases
- Lexical Analysis
  - Scans the source code and transforms the input program into a series of tokens.
  - shows lexical errors, if any.
- Syntax Analysis
  - Shows Syntax errors, if any.
  - It takes all the tokens one by one and uses Context-Free Grammar to construct the parse tree. 
  - It constructs the parse tree to show code structure.

## Tools&languages
- C#
- .net framework
